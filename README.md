# 15-Puzzle-gui

This project is an extended version of my previous 15 Puzzle CLI project, now featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the SFML library. The 15 Puzzle game is a classic sliding puzzle where the objective is to arrange the tiles in ascending order, leaving an empty space for tile movement.
